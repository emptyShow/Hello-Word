I've learn from the Hello World guide.first you need to create a repo,then defaulty there is a Master Branch in it.the Master Branch is for the 
definitely use.in common your work commit and pull to the newly branch .anytime you're satisfy with your work in the newly branch ,you can merge it to the 
master branch.
